One of the most common side effects reported with natural weight loss supplements like Lumilean is digestive discomfort. This can include:
Bloating
Gas
Stomach cramps
These side effects tend to be mild and usually subside as your body adjusts to the new supplement. To avoid digestive discomfort, it’s recommended to take Lumilean with food, especially if you have a sensitive stomach.
